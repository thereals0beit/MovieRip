MovieRip
========

This is my (no longer supported) application I made which would allow me to watch videos on the internet without ads. It did this by parsing API data (or scraping HTML data) and somehow getting a direct FLV or MP4 link for each individual host, and feeding it into an embedded jwPlayer.
